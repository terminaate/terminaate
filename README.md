## `about:`

```
Hey. Iâ€™m a frontend developer from Russia that sometimes does devops and backend. Most of the time im using react/next/remix for frontend, and express/nest for backend.

I like putting things together in a way that feels right, both for the user and the code.

Right now I'm focused on trying to do "cool" things, whether it's just a cool looking website or something helpful, but I'm also open for freelance opportunities or informal collaborations.
